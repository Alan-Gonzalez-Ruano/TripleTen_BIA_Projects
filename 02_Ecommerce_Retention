## 📌 Objective
Analyze raw transaction logs to:
- Build a 3-step conversion funnel (views → cart → purchase)
- Calculate cohort-based retention by first purchase month
- Track customer behavior over a 4-month lifecycle

---

## 🧹 Data Preparation
- Filtered raw logs to isolate purchase events
- Calculated each user's `first_purchase_date` using pivot table + `VLOOKUP()`
- Created monthly tracking columns: `event_month`, `first_purchase_month`, `cohort_age`

---

## 📊 Funnel Analysis
- Used unique user counts to calculate:
  - Funnel steps: product page views → cart opens → purchases
  - Overall conversion rate & step-by-step drop-offs

---

## 📈 Cohort Analysis
- Grouped users into 6 cohorts based on month of first purchase
- Used `DATEDIF()` to track retention by `cohort_age` (in months)
- Built retention matrix with user counts and % retention over 4 months

---

## 📝 Executive Summary
- Funnel drop-off was most significant at the cart stage → optimize UX or incentives
- Earlier cohorts had stronger retention → opportunity to study acquisition channels
- Project organized with Table of Contents and polished spreadsheet formatting
